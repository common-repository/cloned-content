Easily broadcast content on your website to multiple pages using shortcodes. Allows you to edit content in one location instead of having to edit in multiple.

== Description ==

This lightweight plugin allows you to broadcast content on your website to multiple pages using our Visual Composer element or shortcodes. This is a great feature when you want to display the same content on multiple pages. It allows you to broadcast from one location so if you ever have to update something in the future, you only have to do it once.

== How It Works ==

Let's say you want to add a Newsletter signup form to 10 pages on your website. You would create a new page called 'Newsletter Signup' and create the section that you want to clone.
Next, you would edit the pages you want the Newsletter signup form to display on. You can either use the Visual Composer Cloned Content element or a shortcode to display the cloned content.
Simply selected the Visual Composer Cloned Content element and page in the page slug for 'Newsletter Signup'.

That's it! The newsletter signup will now display on that page.

If you don't have Visual Composer installed on your website you can simple use the plugins shortcode:

`[cloned-content page='']`

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

e.g.

1. Upload the cloned-content folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
1. Configure settings by going to Settings > Cloned Content
